## About Me
I'm from Fresno, California and one of my hobbies is working on cars. I drive a 2006 Ford Mustang that I would like to upgrade both cosmetically and internally. Along with working on cars, I enjoy diagnosing issues with both technology and with cars so hopefully my future career will involve these skills.
